# Spring Boot Task 1 ‚Äì Basic Web Application with Controller and View

This project is the first hands-on Spring Boot exercise. It introduces the fundamentals of creating a web application using Spring Framework. The focus is on understanding how controllers, views, and HTTP requests interact in a basic Spring MVC architecture.

## üéØ Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Set up a new Spring Boot project from scratch using [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io)
- Create a simple Spring Controller
- Handle an HTTP request (GET method by default)
- Render a basic HTML view using Thymeleaf
- Understand the use of `@ResponseBody` and `@Controller` annotations

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Configuration

The project is created using the following settings:

- **Build Tool:** Maven  
- **Language:** Java  
- **Spring Boot Version:** Latest (stable, not snapshot)  
- **Packaging:** JAR  
- **Java Version:** Compatible with your installed JDK  
- **Dependencies:**
  - Spring Web
  - Thymeleaf
  - Lombok

After downloading the project ZIP, it should be imported into IntelliJ IDEA.

## üß† What You‚Äôll Learn

- How to configure a Spring Boot project and manage dependencies
- The role of a `Controller` class in Spring MVC
- How to define routes that handle HTTP requests
- How to create a simple HTML file using Thymeleaf to display data
- How to add and display images in your web project

---

## üíª Application Flow

1. **Start the application** ‚Äì Run the project inside IntelliJ; it should start on `localhost:8080`.

2. **Browser interaction** ‚Äì A user can visit a specific route (e.g., `/greeting`) and see a custom HTML page.

3. **Controller response** ‚Äì The backend sends either a direct string (`@ResponseBody`) or renders a `greeting.html` view.

4. **Frontend appearance** ‚Äì The HTML page includes text and images

## ‚úÖ Outcome

By the end of this task, you will have a basic but functional Spring Boot application that:
- Responds to HTTP requests
- Renders an HTML view
- Displays text and an image
- Lays the foundation for future Spring MVC and RESTful projects
